## COMP 3122 Outline Draft
Note, this is a draft and is subject to change

## Course description
This course is an introduction to the field of data-driven AI  and Machine Learning using Python. It will start with the hands-on introduction of essential Python tools and libraries used for manipulating, visualizing and transforming data such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and IPython. It will then build on top of those tools to introduce some of the most established and frequently used Machine Learning algorithms using the Scikit-Learn library.

NOTE: This is a handbook style book with each chapter providing a fairly deep exploration of its subject. The course will be based on the first few sections of each chapter. This will provide a gentle practical introduction into the field while leaving the student with a clear path towards a deeper exploration of each subject.
